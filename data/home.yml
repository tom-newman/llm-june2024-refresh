  text: "<p>Managing cash flow and chasing late payments can be a major headache for local businesses, leading to stress and strained relationships.</p>
          <p>We understand that cash flow issues often stem from a ripple effect of unpaid invoices - a cycle of "I can't pay because I haven't been paid." Traditional methods like invoice factoring are not the solution.</p>
          <p>Instead, Local Loop offers a unique, collaborative approach using advanced network science to identify and resolve payment gridlocks. It starts on the map!</p>"

  title: "The power of the network graph..."
  text: "<p>Under business-as-usual, we know about our customers and suppliers, and maybe a little about our supply chain here and there.</p>
  <p>But when we share a bit of trading information, the network graph of the local economy is revealed.</p>
  <p>And with sophisticated Collaborative Finance tools we can do things which seem almost magical – systematically eliminate debt, optimise the use of available cash, give business clusters ways to make their trade credit go further, plug gaps in the circular economy, incubate start-up ecosystems, and insulate the local economy as a whole from credit crunches.</p>
  <p>We're starting with 'loop clearing' - eliminating gridlocked B2B debts on a 28-day cycle. Read on to see how it could boost your business - together, we can turbocharge the Merseyside economy.</p>"
