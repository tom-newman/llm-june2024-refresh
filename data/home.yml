  text: "<p>Under business-as-usual, we know about our customers and suppliers, and maybe a little about our supply chain here and there.</p>
  <p>But when we share a bit of trading information, the network graph of the local economy is revealed.</p>
  <p>And with sophisticated Collaborative Finance tools we can do things which seem almost magical – systematically eliminate debt, optimise the use of available cash, give business clusters ways to make their trade credit go further, plug gaps in the circular economy, incubate start-up ecosystems, and insulate the local economy as a whole from credit crunches.</p>
  <p>We're starting with 'loop clearing' - eliminating gridlocked B2B debts on a 28-day cycle. Read on to see how it could boost your business - together, we can turbocharge the Merseyside economy.</p>"
